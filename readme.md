# Project description
This repository contains the Laravel API for
our [Vue PWA](https://github.com/pimhooghiemstra/plintpwa-vue-1) developed in the blog series. You can read more on our [blog](https://www.blog.plint-sites.nl)
or on [Medium](https://medium.com/plint-sites).

The sample app we have built uses the [Webpush notification channel package](https://github.com/laravel-notification-channels/webpush). This needs some setup and configuration.
